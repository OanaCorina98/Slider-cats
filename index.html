                <h1>Bengal cat</h1>
                <p>The Bengal cat is a domesticated cat breed created from a hybrid of the Asian leopard cat
                    (Prionailurus bengalensis), with domestic cats, especially the spotted Egyptian Mau. It is then
                    usually bred with a breed that demonstrates a friendlier personality, because after breeding a
                    domesticated cat with a wildcat, its friendly personality may not manifest in the kitten. The
                    breed's name derives from the leopard cat's taxonomic name.

                <h1>Sphynx cat</h1>
                <p>The Sphynx cat (pronounced SFINGKS, /ˈsfɪŋks/) also known as the Canadian Sphynx, is a breed of cat
                    known for its lack of fur. Hairlessness in cats is a naturally occurring genetic mutation, and the
                    Sphynx was developed through selective breeding of these animals, starting in the 1960s.[1]

                    According to breed standards, the skin should have the texture of chamois leather, as it has fine
                    hairs, or the cat may be completely hairless. </p>

                <h1>Russian-blue cat</h1>
                <p>The Russian Blue Cat (Russian: Русская голубая кошка, romanized: Russkaya golubaya koshka), commonly
                    referred to as just Russian Blue, is a cat breed with colors that vary from a light shimmering
                    silver to a darker, slate grey. The short, dense coat, which stands out from the body, has been the
                    breed's hallmark for more than a century.</p>

                <h1>Scottish-fold cat</h1>
                <p>The Scottish Fold is a breed of domestic cat with a natural dominant gene mutation that affects
                    cartilage throughout the body, causing the ears to "fold", bending forward and down towards the
                    front of the head, which gives the cat what is often described as an "owl-like" appearance.[1]

                    Originally called lop-eared or lops after the lop-eared rabbit, Scottish Fold became the breed's
                    name in 1966.</p>
